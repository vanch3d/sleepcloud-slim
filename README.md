# sleepcloud-slim
A PHP/Slim/D3 port of the Sleep-as-Android &amp; Sleepcloud app ecosystem

## Sleepcloud
For those of us who have a very difficult (and noisy!) sleep, 
[Sleep-as-Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) has proved to be very helpful for 
monitoring sleep patterns. The Android app has a great set of features worth exploring 
but it also offers the possibility to export, store and visualise data in their 
dedicated cloud-based application, [SleepCloud](https://sleep-cloud.appspot.com/).

While the visualisation and exploitation of sleep-related data are more effectively 
done in web apps, not everybody is keen to have their private data stored, consumed 
and shared publicly (even when aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymised).

## Sleepcloud-slim
So, here comes my solution: reinvent the wheel and build my own visualisation toolkit!

Fortunately, SleepCloud data can also be seamlessly exported to third-party 
cloud storage services with APIs (at the moment, only Dropbox or Google Drive seem to be 
supported).
